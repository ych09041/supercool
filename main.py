        Does the back-end execution of the `Record' console command. Called when the first
        word in string is "Record".
        
        Records the current status of the arm, or records waits (meaning pause in motion). Saves data
        to the open file, throws error if file does not exist. Must follow data recording convention 
        noted below.

        Record
        Records all the positions of the arm.

        Record Wait Time
        Records a wait in the control sequence of length Time in milliseconds.
        
        Inputs:
            string: total user input at the console in string format

        Function:
            Upon receiving just the word `Record', gets
                all the linkage positions and saves them in the
                .csv file specified by self.file
                Please note to follow the data recording convention
        Errors:
            Bad input- extra words/numbers in string

            self.file is closed or does not exist. Should print error statement
                instead of failing.
